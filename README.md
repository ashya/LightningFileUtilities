File utilities for Salesforce Lightning. Currently for Salesforce Lightning Experience only.

_Components_

1. File Attacher: Uploads the files on a related recordId as attachments. Currently drag and drop of multiple files only. Click to upload through the file chooser is still being worked on. Large file sizes not implemented yet.

This is all work in progress right now. Plan to update to support Winter 17 style <lightning:* tag use instead of SVG.
